Purpose :
Broker Connection Manager.

Current Stage:
CP-006 – File 4

Overview
--------
This service sits between the Credential Vault and all broker
implementations.

The service never communicates directly with MT5, MT4, cTrader,
Binance or any other SDK.

Instead it depends only on the BrokerAdapter interface.

Why?

This is called the Strategy Pattern.

Changing broker adapters should NEVER require changing this
connection service.

The connection service simply asks:

    "Which adapter should I use?"

and then talks only through the common interface.
